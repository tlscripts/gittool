This is my personal git tool for uploading projects to github. This should only be used to initially upload a project to github and not used in a working production environment. This makes it quick and convenient to upload existing projects, especially if you don't have git global variables information set. 

* For Linux or Mac OS (Nix based OS) only.
* Fill in your info at the top.
* Make sure this script is run from the same level directory that your other git project folders are.
* Written in python 3.6.7
